           <p><a href="https://atlasbiowork.com">atlasbiowork.com</a> and the coming expanded, improved, more flexible soilhealth.app which will be hosted here, are open-source web apps designed to support participatory watershed or community science, and a shared, localized, evidence-based intelligence or <i>distributed cognition</i> on the complex relations between sunlight energy, ecosystem function, and human decisions. This is the opportunity for human society to learn how to work <b>with</b> the most powerful planetary force: coupled carbon and water cycling. This learning cannot remain exclusively digital, but information technology can play a support role in recording and sharing evidence and feedback, and displaying observations and data on maps with a variety of additional layers and contexts.</p>
          <p>Participatory watershed or community science around carbon and water cycling can help students, land managers, citizens, and professionals engage with the various flows and variabilities of solar energy, in addition to the more popular emphases on species, substances or elements (such as C, N, or P), problems, and practices.</p>

          <h2>Three generations of data collection</h2>
          <ol>
          <li>Data collection can be a tool of <b>surveillance,</b> for which standardized and categorized data is needed. This is like the one-way mirrors used decades ago in psychology research that separated the observers from the subjects, and enabled the observers to observe the subjects but not vice-versa. One modern equivalent is the surveillance camera. The subjects of the observation typically do not know how the data is being interpreted or used, and sometimes it is used by rule-based systems in inscrutable ways to gauge compliance, assign a category, make predictions and judgments, or apply a rule. It fosters distrust. Much of what is termed research has tended to use surveillance methods and framing because it makes it easier to aggregate consistent data, and make conclusions that are of interest to researchers.</li>

          <li>Data collection can serve the purposes of feedback and inquiry, and become a reflective <b>mirror</b> by which you see yourself, and increase your self-awareness, and perhaps compare yourself with some kind of average. This can be like knowing your bank balance or your net worth, how fast you can run 5 kilometers, or approximately how well your soil accepts and holds water. It can be a way of asking good questions, and it can help you make decisions toward what you want and need.</li>

          <li>Data collection can serve as feedback, mirror, and a platform for a <b>shared intelligence</b> at the group or community level.
          The designs that foster this will be more collaborative and locally adapted. They may be less aligned with rule-based systems and more adapted to complex domains such as ecosystem function, with the overlapping concerns of land, people, and money.</li>
        </ol>

          <p>These are different purposes, and they overlap. The design of soilhealth.app is slanted toward the second and third, toward feedback, inquiry, participation, and a shared intelligence, and less toward judgment and surveillance with its requirements for data consistency and categorization across space.</p>

            
                       
            <h2><a href="https://atlasbiowork.com">atlasbiowork.com:</a></h2>
          <ul>
            <li>data entry forms combine text, numbers, photos with location for display on map</li>
            <li>design and configure new, custom data forms in minutes</li>
            <li>mobile or desktop, data can be entered with or without network</li>
            <li>data easily exported via API and shared</li>
            
          </ul>
            
          <h2>soilhealth.app will add:</h2>
          <ul>
          <li>search by text, data type, user, date, location (this will also allow for more flexible associations between observations than was possible with atlasbiowork.com)</li>
          <li>easy import or mashup of external georeferenced data, both vector and raster: .csv, .geojson, .kml, tilesets, etc. (Shapefiles and other formats can be converted to these.)</li>
          <li>each project has its own coordinators/facilitators, and can configure data forms, forms of data sharing including notifications or subscriptions, and context maps or mashups--<b>a local data collaborative</b></li>
          <li>focused more on local and regional <i>projects</i> around a shared, participatory, evidence-based intelligence
          
           </ul>
        <p>because no two places, people, ranches, or farms are the same, or are asking the same questions!</p>
        
        <p>Confucius said:</p>
        <i><p>Tell me, and I forget.</p>
        <p>Show me, and I remember.</p>
        <p>Let me do, and I understand.</p></i>
        <p>Can a data management platform be designed to facilitate participatory learning, inquiry, and feedback, big-picture (yet local, grounded, and shared) understanding of the circle of life, the most powerful planetary force?</p>
